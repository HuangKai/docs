# Updating Plugins

Plugins are updated automatically when new versions are released and approved, so there is no need to check for updates manually. (Updated plugins will only start running the next time you reload or open a new tab though)

We'll show an update message and a badge in the File Browser when one of your plugins has been updated.

You can click it to see what's new in the update.

!> To protect users from malicious code, we only approve and publish new releases after a manual code review. This may cause a delay between developers releasing new versions of their plugins and them being available to users.
