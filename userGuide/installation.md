<p>

Apps on Windows and Mac are usually signed with code signatures that verify the identities of their developers. However, these code signatures cost hundreds of dollars to obtain.

Figma Plus is a free and non-profit project. We did not invest in getting code signatures so you will see an error warning about unidentified developers when opening our installer apps.
